Version controls helps you to become 
a better programmer, because it lets you
compare and try out different ways of problem solving

What do you think are the pros and cons 
of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: You can generate less clutter, if automatic, there is an
chance that the code wont compile

Cons: What if you forget!?

Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because in programming, integrations between different files
is vital for the program to run properly

How can you use the commands git log and 
git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives you overview of all the commits made with
their unique IDs and comments. Git diff shows clear differences between
two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?

Because everything is easily revertable!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
